RESPEC COMPANIONS ON HIRE

When a companion is hired, this mod strips their focus points and attributes to 0 and refunds the points for you to spend yourself.

This only occurs the first time a companion is hired.

If you kick a companion from your clan with unspent points remaining, they will spend them on the next weekly tick.

PLEASE NOTE

This is a beta version, and while it seems to work OK there's a chance it will go horribly wrong. Use at your own risk (and let me know if it goes horribly wrong). I have left the debug information visible for now, so you can double-check the mod is behaving itself.

BUT WHAT ABOUT SKILLS?

That's a whole other thing. Skills aren't meant to be added manually, so there's no inbuilt functionality for 'unspent skillpoints', or UI elements etc. Maybe one day.

FUTURE PLANS

Put a respec button on the character screen?
